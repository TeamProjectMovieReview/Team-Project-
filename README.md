## Introduction
```
This is our movie trailer platform.

This is where you can be the next potential movie critic and enthusiast.
Our users get to view more movie trailers they can possibly comprehend to find the next
perfect movie for them. Using and integrating Youtube API and ODMP API, you get access from
blockbuster films to hidden gems to movies 20 years old and beyond.

What makes us unique and different from other sources is that you’re not just a viewer
but you’re also a creator. By choosing and saving your favorite movies you get to create
a trailer environment that is just specifically enhanced and handpicked for you. Easily 
save your favorite trailers, creating a personalized collection that perfectly reflects your
unique taste. It's a personalized library that you’ve hand chosen to be your own movie sanctuary.

Our platform is more than just watching trailers and discovering your next favorite trailer, its a community,
allowing you to go out into the world and engage with fellow movie enthusiasts and watch new trailers together.

Allow our website to help you uncover hidden gems and cinematic treasures to find new movies and new
recommendations with the latest data and movies . This is just a beginning, we are constantly
working to improve and enhance user engagement.

It’s like a free show where you can access as many captivating and user engaging trailers you may possibly desire.

## Motivation for development

```
We created this project because of the increase in the current movie market and to create a user
friendly environment to help individuals to browse trailers and choose specific movies they would prefer.

The rising popularity of streaming services in todays time increases the demand to not only websites that show movies
but also sites that offer specific space to be able to view and discover new movie trailers that match their taste.

Adding and partnering with movie streamers or potentially starting our own with a subscription would be a great way
to further enhance this project. Movie trailers are also a great way to engage and captivate user audiences pulling
them into their own movie world. Our website and our motivation also lies in the great diversity within our site.

Allowing discover films they might have otherwise never known existed, or a genre they might like which they had not
thought about. With today’s consumer behavior of preferring bite size and visually appealing content, our website is
ideal as it allows users to watch trailers and decide on their own weather they’d like to go view this movie.

Another reason for this project is by adding these external API’s, alongside with meeting project requirements,
we’ve been able to integrate high quality content for users and allows them to find exactly what they are looking for.

## User Story

```
Being the movie enthusiasts that we are, we were aiming to create a website that makes it easier for us to view and
easily navigate through an extensive collection of movies to pick and chose.

We also wanted a way to save possible movies into local storage to be able to revisit them at our own convenience,
for when we obtain a chance to view and watch a movie.This website allows me curated section for my chosen trailers,
allowing me to save and revisit at my own discretion. It enables me to easily explore endless movies, many unheard of,
all while keeping the website engaging.

## Project Requirements

```
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application
that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project
that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two [server-side APIs]
  (https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards
  (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```

## Presentation Requirements

```
